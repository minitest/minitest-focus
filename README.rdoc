rdoc :: http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest-focus

== DESCRIPTION:

Allows you to focus on a few tests with ease without having to use
command-line arguments. Good for tools like guard that don't have
enough brains to understand test output. Cf. minitest-autotest (an
example of a test runner with strong testing logic).

Inspired by https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/issues/213

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* `focus` class method allows you to specify that the next test
  defined should be run.
* Use --no-focus to temporarily disable or override with --name
  arguments.

== SYNOPSIS:

    require "minitest/autorun"
    require "minitest/focus"

    class MyTest < Minitest::Test
      def test_unrelated; ...; end       # will NOT run

      focus def test_method2; ...;  end  # will run (direct--preferred)

      focus
      def test_method; ...;  end         # will run (indirect)

      def test_method_edgecase; ...; end # will NOT run
    end

    # or, with spec-style:

    describe "MyTest2" do
      focus; it "does something"       do pass end
      focus  it("does something else") {  pass   } # block precedence needs {}

      focus
      describe "Group" do
        it "should run this"           do pass end
        it "will run this too"         do pass end
        describe "Nesting" do
          it "even this"               do pass end
        end
      end

      focus describe("Group") {
        it "or even this"              do pass end
      }
    end
