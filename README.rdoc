== DESCRIPTION:

Allows you to focus on a few tests with ease without having to use
command-line arguments. Good for tools like guard that don't have
enough brains to understand test output. Cf. ZenTest's autotest (an
example of a test runner with strong testing logic).

Inspired by https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/issues/213

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* `focus` class method allows you to specify that the next test
  defined should be run.

== SYNOPSIS:

    require "minitest/autorun"
    require "minitest/focus"

    class MyTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
      def test_unrelated; ...; end

      focus
      def test_method; ...;  end # only this one will run

      def test_method_edgecase; ...; end
    end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* minitest 4.3.4+
